# Camunda
> Camunda is a Java-based framework supporting BPMN for workflow and process automation, CMMN for Case Management and DMN for Business Decision Management

###Overview of Camunda

![Camunda](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/introduction/img/architecture-overview.png)

* **Process Engine** <br />
The process engine is a Java library responsible for executing BPMN 2.0 processes, 
CMMN 1.1 cases and DMN 1.1 decisions.
It has a lightweight POJO core and uses a relational database for persistence. 
ORM mapping is provided by the MyBatis mapping framework.


* **Camunda Modeler** <br />
Camunda Modeler is a desktop application for modeling BPMN, DMN and CMMN. 
It allows you to model files located directly on your local file system.



* **Web Applications**
    * [REST API](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/reference/rest/): 
        The goal of the REST API is to provide access to all relevant interfaces of the engine.
    
    * [Camunda Tasklist](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/tasklist/) <br />
        Tasklist is a web application that allows you to work on User Tasks. It allows you
        Start a Process, Create a Filter, Claim Tasks, Working on Tasks,
         Set Follow-Up Date (reminder), Comment a Task and Set Due Date
        
     ![TaskList](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/tasklist/img/tasklist-dashboard.png)
        
    * [Camunda Cockpit](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/cockpit/) <br />
        Camunda BPM Cockpit is a web application for monitoring and operations. 
        It provides access to deployed BPMN processes and DMN decisions, 
        allows searching though running and ended instances and performing operations on these. <br />
        
        It consists of 
        [Dashboard](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/cockpit/dashboard/),
        [BPMN Processes](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/cockpit/bpmn/),
        [DMN Decisions](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/cockpit/dmn/),
        [CMMN Cases](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/cockpit/cmmn/), 
        [Deployments](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/cockpit/deployment-view/), 
        [Auditing](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/cockpit/auditing/) and 
        [Reports](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/cockpit/reporting/)
         ![Cockpit](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/cockpit/img/dashboard.png)
    
    * [Camunda Admin](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/webapps/admin/) <br />
         A web application that allows you to manage users, groups and authorizations.

###Architecture Overview
Camunda BPM can be used both as a standalone process engine server or embedded inside custom Java applications.

**Process Engine Architecture**<br />
![](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/introduction/img/process-engine-architecture.png)

* **[Process Engine Public API](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/user-guide/process-engine/process-engine-api/)**<br/>
Service-oriented API allowing Java applications to interact with the process engine. 
The different responsibilities of the process engine (i.e., Process Repository, Runtime Process Interaction, Task Management, â€¦) are separated into individual services.
 The public API features a command-style access pattern.  ProcessEngine and the services objects are thread safe. So you can keep a reference to 1 of those for a whole server.
 
* **BPMN 2.0 Core Engine**<br/>
This is the core of the process engine. It features a lightweight execution engine for graph structures 
(PVM - Process Virtual Machine), a BPMN 2.0 parser which transforms BPMN 2.0 XML files into Java Objects 
and a set of BPMN Behavior implementations (providing the implementation for BPMN 2.0 constructs such as Gateways or Service Tasks).


* **[Job Executor](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.7/user-guide/process-engine/the-job-executor/)** <br/>
The Job Executor is responsible for processing asynchronous background work such as Timers or asynchronous continuations in a process.


* **The Persistence Layer**<br/>
The process engine features a persistence layer responsible for persisting process instance state to a relational database.
 Camunda uses the MyBatis mapping engine for object relational mapping.
